Data Management project 

Cerabolini Aurora- Strada Corinna- Tritella Mirko


Our goal is to create a graph database that contains information regarding most of the existing anime (around 15,000) that can be useful for building a content-based anime recommendation system.


To do this, we will use two sources.
The first one consists of the APIs provided by https://aniapi.com ; then, we will scrape some more useful information from https://www.anime-planet.com/.

After an exploratory analysis of the downloaded data, we will deal with quality evaluation and improvement, in particular regarding completeness and accuracy.

Once the data has been integrated and cleaned up, we will store the information in a graph database.

The chosen Database Management System is Neo4J and that is because with recommendation systems, it is crucial to evaluate relationships and clusters in the data.
